# COS226-Game

The live web app is hosted at http://cos226game.cs.princeton.edu/

This repository contains web files for a game web app for COS 226, Princeton's algorithms and data structures class. The web app was created using PHP and little JavaScript. Since this web app was a proof of concept, it does not utilize a real database but rather a simple CSV file to store each user's stats. 3 Levels are currently implemented on the web app covering the topics of heaps, undirected graphs, and directed graphs. My final report on this project is included in the root directory, titled "written_final_report.pdf".

To develop or add features to the web app, simply follow these steps:

1) Copy the "database.csv" file and the "includes" and "templates" directories to the root directory of your local host or web server.

2) Copy the contents of the "public" folder to your local host or web server public directory (the directory that will host your web files and is accessible to the public).

3) In your public directory folder, open the "path.php" file and add to it the root directory path as is shown in the comments.

That's it. Happy developing!
